# Since this is also read by miners/config.py for some of its configuration, this hosts file's
#   format is somewhat constrained. It must include this [miners] group listing the <IP_ADDR>
#   (or an appropriately registered  hostname), a hostname=<HOSTNAME> parameter, and a 
#   platform=<PLATFORM> parameter, as in this example.
