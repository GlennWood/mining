Monit Monitoring System
=======================

The [Monit](https://mmonit.com/) service helps you monitor and restart failed services on multiple hosts.

Monit is a service monitoring daemon. It can be used to monitor processes, files, system and remote hosts, and if necessary, take configured actions when specific parameters change, like restarting services and notifying the system administrator.
